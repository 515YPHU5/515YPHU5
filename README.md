I write software that is blazingly fast, compliant to strategic alignments, 10000x secure.  

I also save animals, environmentally optimized CO2 metrics, wrote a physics engine in react. All of this was done in my free time while working 3 part time jobs, volunteering and while I was in school, so just the typical Ivy League applicant.
